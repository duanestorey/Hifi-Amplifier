## Version 2.0

### Project Style Guide

### Power Monitors

There are several INA260 power meters.  

1) MAIN Digital/Analog PSU monitor, address GND/SCL
2) MAIN Positive rail for channel amplifiers, address SCL/GND
3) 7V to 5V converter, address GND/GND
4) 7V to 3V converter, address GND/3V
5) Positive analog converter,  3V/GND
6) Entire 7V converter, 3V/3V

### Temperature Sensors

1) Microprocessor board, address GND/GND
2) Digital/Analog PSU, address GND/3V

### LED lights and resistors

The following voltages and LED colours should be used for consistency. In general, all LEDs are set at 2ma of current are 0603 size.

#### Digital Voltages

3.3V - Blue, set to ~2ma using 150R 
5.0V - Red, set to ~2ma using 1.3K

#### Analog Voltages

+3.3V - Yellow, set to ~2ma using 620R
+9.5V - Yellow, set to ~2ma using 3.6K
-9.5V - Blue, set to ~2ma using 3.3K
+34V - Yellow, set to ~2ma using 16K
-34V - Blue, set to ~2ma using 16K
Positive DC - Yellow, set to 2ma
Negative DC - Blue, set to 2ma

### Design Goals
- Switch amplifier to LM4766, 2 boards, 4 channels
    - should have a microcontrolled mute
- Design miniDSP using adau1701
- Simply power supplies - take all three from the toroidal
- Modify microprocessor to have more ADC for current monitoring, and more GPIOs using add-on
- Possibly combine subwoofer board with miniDSP post-DAC filtering
- Small signal relay for swithing between filtered from channels or not
- New SPDIF board with more inputs
- Separate DAC Board or make it a HAT

#### Microprocessor

- TODO: Add connector for IR diode [IR Receiver](https://www.conrad.com/en/p/tru-components-os-0038-n-ir-receiver-non-standard-axial-lead-38-khz-5-8-mm-940-nm-35-1567234.html?srsltid=AfmBOooULA3z41DL8Pl4VzeSBMj5sArhngCSZTbEgrS--_IQduufNs6r#productDownloads)
- TODO: Add GPIO board as a HAT

#### SPDIF / DAC

- TODO: Split into separate boards, via a HAT probably
- TODO: Possibly change SPDIF connectors to screw terminals

#### SPDIF

- TODO: ADded more inputs
- TODO: Maybe add isolation transformers
- TODO: Change ground plane so SPDIF ground doesn't interfere with analog DAC ground
