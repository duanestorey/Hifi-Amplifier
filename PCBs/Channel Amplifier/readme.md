# LM3886 Channel Amplifiers

The LM3886 has a somewhat mythical status ever since a $3,000 gaincard was released in 1999.  It had amazing sound quality, but inside was only a tweaked LM3886 Texas Instrument 68W amplifier IC.  Since then, an entire community has evolved around these 'gainclones', which truly are hi-fidelity.  This project uses 5 of these, along with a Dolby Decoder IC, to create a complete DIY hi-fidelity 5.1 system.
