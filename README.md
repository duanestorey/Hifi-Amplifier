# Hifi-Amplifier
A Custom 5.1 LM3886 Based Custom Amplifier

A breakdown of the directory structure is as follows:

* PCBs - Each of the required PCBs in detail - currently a work in progress and incomplete as the code has recently been changed from a STM32
* Code/ESP32 - The main amplifier code, written to run on an ESP32 WROOM 32 processor

## Design Philosophy

# PCBs

After iterations over several months to determine PCB usefulness and sizes, most PCBs now utilize a 55mmx55mm size.  This is under the minimum of 100mmx100mm low-cost options 
at several of the large-scale PCB manufacturing sites, and allows useful stacking of PCBs within the chassis.
